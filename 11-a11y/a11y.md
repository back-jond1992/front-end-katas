## What is a11y?

_a11y_ stands for _"Accessibility"_ (there are `11` characters between the `'a'` and the `'y'`)

Accessibility in web development strives to allow as many people as possible to access and enjoy our apps and web pages regardless of any disability or impairment. Checking whether your application is accessible should be a repeated and ongoing process throughout development.

According to the [scope](https://www.scope.org.uk/media/disability-facts-figures/) there are at least 14.1 million disabled people in the UK.

Not only should accessibility be an ethical concern it may also be a legal requirement depending on what you're making. The UK government website lays out [accessibility requirements for public sector bodies here](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps)

## WCAG

If you research accessibility you will find that most resources and guidance for accessibility for the web will reference the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines** (WCAG). These guidelines, published by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), are the internationally recognised standard for web accessibility. The first iteration of the guidelines were published in 1999. At time of writing a [working draft of WCAG 2.2 was released May 2021](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/).

The WCAG guidelines cover four principles:

- **Perceivable** - Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

  > This means that users must be able to perceive the information being presented (it can't be invisible to all of their senses)

- **Operable** - User interface components and navigation must be operable.

  > This means that users must be able to operate the interface (the interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform)

- **Understandable** - Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.

  > This means that users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface (the content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding)

- **Robust** - Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

  > This means that users must be able to access the content as technologies advance (as technologies and user agents evolve, the content should remain accessible)

Accompanying these principles are a number of **guidelines**, **success criteria** and **techniques** you can use to meet the guidelines.

For example:

- `Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable` covers visual and audio elements of a page and lays out how we can make it easier for our users to see and hear our content.
- `Success Criterion 1.4.1 Use of Color` states:
  > Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.
- `Techniques` include:
  - Ensuring that information conveyed by color differences is also available in text
  - Ensuring that additional visual cues are available when text color differences are used to convey information

So in practical terms:

- making something red isn't enough to show an 'error' - you should accompany it with text and/or symbols! ⚠️🙅❗

You should also be aware of the "Conformance Levels" the success criteria have

- **A** : Essential
- **AA** : Ideal Support
- **AAA**: Specialised Support

> `1.4.1 Use of Color` is **A** so you should make sure you do it to meet the bare minimum standards!

## Accessibility Tools

The device you're reading this on will almost certainly have some accessibility features installed on it. Windows, Mac, Linux operating systems as well as iOS and Android devices have high contrast display modes, screen readers, magnifying features, text size settings and more.

If you're reading this in VSCode opening up the command palette (`cmd + shift + p` for MacOs, `ctrl + shift + p` for linux/windows) and see how many of the features of Visual Studio Code are available to those who might find it difficult to use a mouse.

## Checking Accessibility

Sometimes you can clearly tell at a glance if something is not accessible - for example if text is too small or doesn't have enough contrast with it's background. Other times you will need to either manually interact with your application, pay for some expensive user testing or use some of the excellent tools that exist to help you.

Here are some that you could try out:

- [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/)
- [wave](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/)
- [funckify](https://www.funkify.org/)
- Your browsers in built developer tools!

## Tasks

Oh dear oh dear. Doug has created a front end for a joke database but he's put no thought into the accessibility. In fact he's managed to add some features that make his site completely inaccessible!

Each task is related to a WCAG guideline. Feel free to use the techniques suggested by the guidance in your solutions!

### 2.1.2 No Keyboard Traps

Okay, first things first. Doug says this annoying pop-up _has_ to stay but currently it has a keyboard trap - try it out - you can't use the site with only your keyboard!

- Remove the keyboard trap, the user should be able to exit the pop-up using keyboard only

### 1.4: Distinguishable

A lot of the text and buttons are difficult to read. Inspecting the colour of the text in your browser should help here - most browsers give accessibility scores for you!

- Put and contrasting background behind the text and/or change the colour of the text to make it more readable!

When a submits without correctly filling out the joke submission form the form turns red. Provide another visual indicator for an error

**TASK IDEAS**

- vote buttons that are just red/green with "vote" text
- complicated error messages
- web convention

**REWORD THIS**

> WCAG has been the internationally recognised standard for web accessibility for more than 20 years. WCAG 1.0 was published by the W3C in 1999, WCAG 2.0 in 2008, and WCAG 2.1 in 2018. The W3C is now working on WCAG 2.2 and expects to publish it sometime during the last 3 months of 2020.
