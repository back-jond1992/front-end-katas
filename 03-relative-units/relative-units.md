# Relative-units

In CSS, relatively length units are units that relative in size to something else, e.g - the size of their parent element.

### Types Of Relative Units in CSS

- em
- rem
- vh
- vw
- line-height

There are a few others however these are the ones we will use for this kata!

## TASKS:

We have created a small information card about the master of relativity himself, **Albert Einstein**, however a things need to be amended!

### Task 1:

The font the bio section is looking a little small. The default font size for text in a HTML document is 16px. Using the **rem** unit, put it back to the default font size.

### Task 2:

Oh no!! Something has happened to our text...it has become all jumbled up and is now very difficult to read. Using **line-height** , let's see if we can make this text more readable! (hint...line-height is generally 20% larger than the current font size!)

### Task 3:

Now that we have our paragraphs sorted, it's seem that the quote items are a little too big! Using the **em** unit, let's change the font size to the default equivalent of 16px
