# box-model

On a webpage everything is a box. Whether it's a `<div>`, `<ul>`, `<p>`, `<span>` or anything else it will be positioned and rendered in a rectangle.

The shape size, and exact positioning of an element will depend on various attributes including:

- `display`
- `padding`
- `margin`
- `border`
- `box-sizing`
- and more...
